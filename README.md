# Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world, full-stack web application built to simulate the features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed to help learners gain hands-on experience in backend development, database modeling, API design, security implementation, and DevOps practices.

This project is part of the ALX Pro Dev Backend Program, aimed at fostering collaborative software development, version control best practices, and technical documentation skills.
