Pro-Dev Backend Project

# Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world, full-stack web application built to simulate the features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed to help learners gain hands-on experience in backend development, database modeling, API design, security implementation, and DevOps practices.

This project is part of the ALX Pro Dev Backend Program, aimed at fostering collaborative software development, version control best practices, and technical documentation skills.

## 🧑🏽‍💻 Team Roles

This project follows a collaborative, real-world development model. The following roles help ensure accountability, quality, and progress throughout the lifecycle of the Airbnb Clone Project.

| **Role**                         | **Responsibilities** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Backend Developer**            | Implements the core application logic using Django. Develops RESTful APIs, handles data validation, integrates third-party services, and ensures the code is efficient, secure, and scalable. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs and manages the MySQL database schema. Defines entity relationships, handles migrations, ensures data integrity, and optimizes performance. Collaborates closely with backend developers. |
| **API Architect / Integration Specialist** | Designs API structures and ensures proper communication between backend services and external consumers. Handles authentication protocols, rate limiting, and consistent data formatting. |
| **Security Specialist**          | Implements and enforces security measures including authentication, input validation, encryption, and access control. Performs threat modeling and code security audits. |
| **DevOps Engineer**              | Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. Handles containerization with Docker, deployment configurations, server provisioning, and system monitoring. |
| **Technical Writer / Documentation Lead** | Creates and maintains all project documentation including README files, API references, setup guides, and contribution instructions. Ensures clarity, consistency, and accessibility. |
| **Project Manager (Optional)**   | Oversees team planning, communication, and timelines. Tracks issues, facilitates resolution of blockers, and ensures team alignment and progress. *(Note: Often rotated/shared in learning environments)* |

> *Note: In smaller learning teams, individuals may take on multiple roles to promote flexibility and cross-functional growth.*

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern technology stack to simulate a real-world, scalable backend system. Each technology plays a vital role in ensuring the application is robust, maintainable, and secure.

| **Technology** | **Purpose in the Project** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Django** | A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable backend systems. Used to build the core server logic and APIs. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs with features like serialization, authentication, and permissions. |
| **MySQL** | A relational database system used to store structured data such as users, listings, bookings, and reviews. It supports complex queries and relational data modeling. |
| **GraphQL** (optional) | A query language for APIs and runtime for executing those queries. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, promoting efficiency and flexibility. |
| **Docker** | A containerization platform that ensures the application runs consistently across different environments. It packages the app and its dependencies into portable containers. |
| **Git & GitHub** | Git is a version control system used to track code changes, while GitHub hosts the repository and supports collaboration through issues, pull requests, and actions. |
| **GitHub Actions** | A CI/CD automation tool within GitHub used to automate testing, deployment, and other development workflows. |
| **Swagger / OpenAPI** | Tools used to document and visualize RESTful APIs. Helps developers and users understand and test API endpoints. |
| **Markdown** | A lightweight markup language used to format documentation files such as `README.md`, API references, and contribution guides. |

> *Note: Additional tools or frameworks may be introduced as the project evolves to meet advanced functionality or deployment needs.*

## 🗄️ Database Design

This project uses a relational database (MySQL) to model real-world entities such as users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. The database is designed using normalized structures to ensure scalability, data integrity, and ease of query.

### 🔑 Key Entities & Attributes

Below are the primary entities and their essential fields:

---

### 1. **User**
Represents the people who use the platform to either host or book properties.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `is_host` (Boolean to differentiate guests from hosts)

---

### 2. **Property**
Represents the properties listed by hosts on the platform.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

---

### 3. **Booking**
Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

---

### 4. **Review**
Captures feedback left by users after staying at a property.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `rating` (Integer)
- `comment`

---

### 5. **Payment**
Stores records of payments for bookings.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Booking)
- `payment_date`
- `amount`
- `payment_method`

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- **A User** can own **multiple Properties**.  
- **A User** can make **multiple Bookings** for different Properties.  
- **A Property** can have **many Reviews** and **many Bookings**.  
- **A Booking** is associated with **one Property** and **one User**.  
- **A Booking** has **one Payment**.  
- **A User** can write **many Reviews** for different Properties.

> 📌 This relational structure ensures that every data point can be traced back to the source while enabling powerful queries for features like listing search, user history, and analytics.

---

### 📈 Coming Soon:
An ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) will be added to visually represent these relationships.
