## 🗄️ Database Design

This project uses a relational database (MySQL) to model real-world entities such as users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. The database is designed using normalized structures to ensure scalability, data integrity, and ease of query.

### 🔑 Key Entities & Attributes

Below are the primary entities and their essential fields:

---

### 1. **User**
Represents the people who use the platform to either host or book properties.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `is_host` (Boolean to differentiate guests from hosts)

---

### 2. **Property**
Represents the properties listed by hosts on the platform.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

---

### 3. **Booking**
Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

---

### 4. **Review**
Captures feedback left by users after staying at a property.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `rating` (Integer)
- `comment`

---

### 5. **Payment**
Stores records of payments for bookings.

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Booking)
- `payment_date`
- `amount`
- `payment_method`

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- **A User** can own **multiple Properties**.  
- **A User** can make **multiple Bookings** for different Properties.  
- **A Property** can have **many Reviews** and **many Bookings**.  
- **A Booking** is associated with **one Property** and **one User**.  
- **A Booking** has **one Payment**.  
- **A User** can write **many Reviews** for different Properties.

> 📌 This relational structure ensures that every data point can be traced back to the source while enabling powerful queries for features like listing search, user history, and analytics.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes a range of features that replicate the functionality of the original Airbnb platform. These features are designed to provide a seamless experience for both hosts and guests while offering developers hands-on experience with backend architecture and API development.

---

### 🧑‍💼 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system differentiates between hosts and guests, ensuring secure access and personalized functionality across the platform.

---

### 🏘️ Property Management
Enables hosts to list, update, and delete properties. Each listing includes details such as location, pricing, description, and images. This feature allows hosts to manage their offerings dynamically.

---

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The system handles conflict detection, calculates total cost, and updates availability accordingly.

---

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles secure recording of payment transactions associated with bookings. It tracks amount, method, and payment dates, providing financial traceability and future integration points for real payment gateways.

---

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
Enables guests to leave feedback on properties they have stayed in. This feature promotes trust and quality control by allowing users to rate their experience and share comments.

---

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Implements secure user authentication (e.g., password hashing, JWT tokens) and role-based access control to ensure users can only access appropriate resources.

---

### 📑 API Documentation
Provides a clear and interactive interface for developers to explore and test API endpoints. Using Swagger or similar tools, the documentation enhances maintainability and onboarding for contributors.

---

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions. This ensures consistent quality, speeds up iteration, and reduces the risk of manual deployment errors.

---

### 🐳 Dockerized Environment (Optional)
Packages the entire app in Docker containers for seamless local development and deployment. This ensures consistency across different machines and environments.

---

## 🔐 API Security

Securing the backend API is critical to protecting user data, maintaining trust, and ensuring safe and reliable functionality. This project integrates essential security measures at various layers to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and abuse.

---

### 🔑 Authentication
We will implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only verified users can access protected endpoints. This is crucial for verifying user identity and maintaining session security.

**Why it's important**:  
Prevents unauthorized users from accessing personal data or making bookings under another user's account.

---

### 🛂 Authorization
Role-based access control will be enforced to ensure that users can only perform actions permitted for their role (e.g., only hosts can create listings, only guests can make bookings).

**Why it's important**:  
Protects critical operations by ensuring users don’t access or modify resources they don’t own.

---

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting
We will implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., brute force login attacks, spamming endpoints).

**Why it's important**:  
Helps maintain service availability and protects the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

---

### 📦 Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to avoid injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Why it's important**:  
Prevents malicious data from compromising the database or affecting application behavior.

---

### 🔒 HTTPS (Production Deployment)
All data exchanged between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS in production environments.

**Why it's important**:  
Protects sensitive information such as login credentials and payment data from being intercepted in transit.

---

### 🧪 Security Testing
Basic security tests (e.g., checking auth headers, token expiration, and role access) will be incorporated into our testing strategy.

**Why it's important**:  
Ensures the security mechanisms work as expected and are not bypassed accidentally during updates.

---

> These practices collectively protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system and its data, forming a solid foundation for secure application development.
